# Assumptions

The following assumptions are made for local development:

- the project is checked out into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/jippi/hashi-ui`
- `go` in a recent version (I use `1.9.0` but older 1.8 might also work)
- `node` in a recent version (I use `7.2.1` but older versions should work too)
- `yarn` is installed (`brew install yarn` on OS X)

## Go configuration

I use environment like this for Go development

```
export GOPATH=$HOME/src/go-lang
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

mkdir -p ~/src/go-lang/src/github.com/jippi
cd ~/src/go-lang/src/github.com/jippi
git clone git@github.com:jippi/hashi-ui.git
cd hashi-ui
```
## Vagrant

The option to use Vagrant is also an available. Vagrant must be previously installed. See the Vagrant [docs](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/) for how to get started.

From the root folder, run ``` vagrant up ``` to create the guest machine with go and the go environment pre-configured.

Once Vagrant has provisioned the virtual machine, run ``` vagrant ssh ``` to access the ssh session.

# Workflow

Both the `frontend/` and the `backend/` directory got their own specialized `Makefile`.

They share some common commands like `install`, `build`, `clean` and `dist-clean`.

The root `/Makefile` mirror these commands, and simply run them for you in both directories.

To build the project simply run `make -j build` in the root of the project, and both frontend and backend will be
installed and setup for you, including any dependencies needed for a successful build.

`make build` will build both the frontend and backend projects. Running the command a 2nd time will not compile anything,
since all binaries will exist in the build output directories.

For continuous workflow, use `make -j rebuild` which will remove any build artifact (`make clean`) before running `make build`.

`make rebuild` will also delete the frontend build artifacts, which will cause `webpack` to run again to crate the static
HTML, JS and CSS bundles needed to be embedded in the Go binary at compile time. This process can take a while, so if you
don't need to re-bundle new frontend assets in the Go binary, use `KEEP_BINDATA_ASSETFS=1 make -j rebuild` which will prevent
the deletion of the binary frontend bundle, and just recompile the Go code.

# Development

Run `make -j build` in the root directory to get all dependencies and binaries setup and built.

If the work you plan to do only involve the frontend, run a command similar to this to get the Go server API available:
`NOMAD_LOG_LEVEL=debug NOMAD_ADDR=http://localhost:4646 ./backend/build/hashi-ui-darwin-amd64 --nomad-enable`. You can
enable the Consul UI by setting the `CONSUL_ADDR` environment variable and passing the `--consul-enable` flag.

Once the hashi-ui server is running, go to the `frontend/` directory and run `yarn start`.
Once its running you can access http://0.0.0.0:3333/nomad or http://0.0.0.0:3333/consul for the hot-reloading reactjs
frontend, which will automatically update your browser with any JS changes you do in your editor on file save.

You may get redirected to the Go backend which runs by default on port 3000, so you will need to set the port value back
to 3333 in order to hit the hot-reloading reactjs frontend.

If your code involve Go changes as well, a workflow like the following is fairly efficient (from the `backend/`) directory
`KEEP_BINDATA_ASSETFS=1 make -j rebuild && NOMAD_LOG_LEVEL=debug NOMAD_ADDR=http://localhost:4646 ./build/hashi-ui-darwin-amd64`


# Building

Project is built using make:

```
make
```

The resulting files will be stored in `build/` folder:

```
build/webpack              - frontend webapp that can be served by any webserver
build/hashi-ui-<os>-<arch> - hashi-ui binary containing both the backend server and frontend webapp
```

By default it builds binary for host system. You can cross-compile and
build binaries for different systems and architectures as well:

```
GOBUILD='linux-amd64 windows-386 <GOOS>-<GOARCH>' make
```

See [docs](https://golang.org/doc/install/source) for the whole list of available `GOOS` and `GOARCH`
values.
